# Sphinx documentation
Documentation is generated using Sphinx. 

`API.rst`. `index.rst` and `API.rst` and `How-to.rst` are the content used to generate the sphinx documentation. Files in the `API` directory are auto-generated by the `autosummary` command in `index.rst`. `conf.py` provides the sphinx configuration and the `make` files are used to automate the build.

## Building docs locally
The command `make html` can be used to build the html docs locally. The outputs are stored in the '_build' directory.  


## Deploying using Github pages
The github pages deployment is handlend by `.github/worksflows/sphinx.yml` in the root directory. The `.nojekyll` file in the root directory is required to deploy sphinx docs to github pages.
